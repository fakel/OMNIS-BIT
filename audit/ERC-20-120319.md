## 1. Disclaimer

The audit makes no statements or warranties about utility of the code, safety of the code, suitability of the business model, regulatory regime for the business model, or any other statements about fitness of the contracts to purpose, or their bug free status. The audit documentation is for discussion purposes only.

## 2. Abstract

The following is an audit made to ERC-20.sol (MD5:053816abe1ed8dbf2ab6cd67f0d54e77) smart contract provided by OMNIS-BIT team and will cover a series of technical and good behavior checks.

Version of the code in use is deployed at the ethereum address [0x3123ff80cbdfd35577628a41ff50598cefc2d236](https://etherscan.io/token/0x3123ff80cbdfd35577628a41ff50598cefc2d236), however, it's not yet verified.

The test solidity compiler version used for checks was the 0.4.24 stable version.

## 3. Attack vectors

* **Overflow and underflow attacks**

	Ethereum Virtual Machine memory works in a 256 bit basis, when a variable is read, it's expanded to 256bit size and when the variable is stored it can be sized from 8 to 256 bits. An overflow/underflow attack can be made if the code doesn't check changes made on variables (add, sub, mult, div, exp), for example, if a 8 bit variable is used, it can represent 256 unsigned integer numbers (uint 0 to 255). Lets use 0 and 255 for the example.

       * 0 in binary is 0000 0000 (0x00 hex), if sub 1 from 0 it will become 1111 1111 (0xFF)
       
       * 255 in binary is 1111 1111 (0xFF hex), if add 1 from 255 it will become 0000 0000 (0x00)

	This contract implement a **SafeMath** library capable for overflows and underflows check, **It's globally well used**.



## 4. Vulnerabilities found

* `HIGH` The `mint()` and `burn()` functions are well written at functional level, however, the use of those functions are under control of a single wallet. Also, there is no limitation about the max supply the contract should be able to create and, the access to new tokens or the token holder target for a burn operation, are discretional chosen by the owner of the contract. This might represent a clear transparency violation.

* `LOW` The `burn()` function report the burn of tokens as a transfer event to the zero address, however, the supply is actually reduced. The log should be a specific `Burn` event.

* `LOW` At the date of this review the last stable version of the Solidity compiler is the 0.5.4, the contract is designed to comply with the version 0.4.24. It's a good practice to use a fixed pragma (without ^). This declaration limit natively the code to be compiled with any version <0.5.* to prevent compiler version errors.

* `LOW` The `decimals` variable is `uint256` type, however, the ERC20 standard recommend the use of a `uint8` type.

## 5. Comments

* **contract Owned**
  
  This contract uses an adminship scheme of one owner and a two steps ownership transfer process. It's not possible to set ownership to a zero or non-owned address.
  Since the owner have privileges to create or delete tokens at will, the owner wallet should be a safe wallet. Consider the use of a Multi Signature Contract.

* **totalSupply**
  
  The `totalSupply()` function return as total supply the actual circulating supply minus zero address balance, this represent a kind of burn process, however, some block explorers show the zero address as a holder and, if some one sum all holders balances manually, the `totalSupply()` will differ from the total sum of holders balances, also, this contract already state a `burn()` method. You must be clear about how the standard burn process will actually work for your token.
