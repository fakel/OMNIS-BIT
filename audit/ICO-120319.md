## 1. Disclaimer

The audit makes no statements or warranties about utility of the code, safety of the code, suitability of the business model, regulatory regime for the business model, or any other statements about fitness of the contracts to purpose, or their bug free status. The audit documentation is for discussion purposes only.

## 2. Abstract

The following is an audit made to ICO.sol (MD5:4f8cd7208095ba19dfe49afc74514c06) smart contract provided by OMNIS-BIT team and will cover a series of technical and good behavior checks.

Version of the code in use is supposedly deployed at the ethereum address [0x89F280918540E1A8EA083B1cFFa028C919847D6c](https://etherscan.io/token/0x89F280918540E1A8EA083B1cFFa028C919847D6c), however, it's not yet verified.

The test solidity compiler version used for checks was the 0.4.24 stable version.

## 3. Attack vectors

* **Overflow and underflow attacks**

	Ethereum Virtual Machine memory works in a 256 bit basis, when a variable is read, it's expanded to 256bit size and when the variable is stored it can be sized from 8 to 256 bits. An overflow/underflow attack can be made if the code doesn't check changes made on variables (add, sub, mult, div, exp), for example, if a 8 bit variable is used, it can represent 256 unsigned integer numbers (uint 0 to 255). Lets use 0 and 255 for the example.

       * 0 in binary is 0000 0000 (0x00 hex), if sub 1 from 0 it will become 1111 1111 (0xFF)
       
       * 255 in binary is 1111 1111 (0xFF hex), if add 1 from 255 it will become 0000 0000 (0x00)

	This contract implement a **SafeMath** library capable for overflows and underflows check, **But it's NOT globally well used**.



## 4. Vulnerabilities found

* `HIGH` The `rateOptimizationICO()` function returns a rate of exchange value depending on time frames as follow:
    * [GMT: Tuesday, 5 February 2019 0:00:00,GMT: Friday, 22 March 2019 0:00:00] = 1000
    * [GMT: Saturday, 23 March 2019 0:00:00,GMT: Thursday, 28 March 2019 0:00:00] = 800
    * [Friday, 29 March 2019 0:00:00,Thursday, 11 April 2019 0:00:00] = 750
    * [Saturday, 20 April 2019 0:00:00,GMT: Monday, 22 April 2019 0:00:00] = 700
    * [GMT: Tuesday, 23 April 2019 0:00:00,GMT: Sunday, 28 April 2019 0:00:00] = 650
    * [GMT: Monday, 29 April 2019 0:00:00,GMT: Saturday, 4 May 2019 0:00:00] = 600
    * [GMT: Sunday, 5 May 2019 0:00:00,GMT: Wednesday, 5 June 2019 0:00:00] = 500
    
    Any other time the function returns no value (zero), this lead to 6 whole days where the rate of exchange will not be any expected value. Also, if during deploying the `_closingTime` variable result to be greater than the last time boundary or if `_preSale_closingTime` is lesser than the first time boundary, it will result in the same error (zero rate).

* `HIGH` The `tokenWithdraw()` and `_forwardFunds()` functions let the owner of the contract to retrieve all tokens and ether at any time. If the owner wallet get compromised all funds and tokens could get lose. Also, it's a cleat transparency problem.

* `MEDIUM` At lines 34 and 35 there is a multiplication operation, however, there is no overflow or zero result check even if there is a SafeMath library included on imported code.

* `LOW` At the date of this review the last stable version of the Solidity compiler is the 0.5.4, the contract is designed to comply with the version 0.4.24. It's a good practice to use a fixed pragma (without ^). This declaration limit natively the code to be compiled with any version <0.5.* to prevent compiler version errors.

* `LOW` The `_getTokenAmount()` internal function is declared but not used anywhere, also, it uses the last rate stored on contract and not the current valid rate.

## 5. Comments

* **contract Owned**

	This contract uses an adminship scheme of one owner and a two steps ownership transfer process. It's not possible to set ownership to a zero or non-owned address.
    Since the owner have privileges to retrieve tokens and ether at will, the owner wallet should be a safe wallet. Consider the use of a Multi Signature Contract.

* **Code Style Guide**
    
    This contract does not follow the [Solidity Style Guide](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.5.5/style-guide.html)

* **Code Comments**
    
    The lack of proper comments in this code could be a disadvantage for some users that could not be able to read or understand solidity code, thus leading to a transparency problem.

* **ICO Stages**

    This contract clearly have several stages, this can be represented with the usage of a `state` variable, this way users can know easily at which stage the contract currently is.

* **ICO Status**
    
    This contract doesn't keep a track of ICO status neither Events nor public variables like collected funds or distributed tokens, you should consider include them.
